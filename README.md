# Doorbell

This an Android program I wrote to notify me when my dog wants to come in the back door.

It is used with a small devices that has a proximity sensor. When the dog walks in front of it,
it sends a message to an MQTT broker.

This application then receives the messages and makes a sound whenver it gets one.
